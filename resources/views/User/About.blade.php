                Apartments is the right solution. Whether it's short or medium term stay, customers will appreciate
                the additional space, privacy, comfort and freedom of our serviced apartments at prices they'll

                Sterling Executive Residential is a safe way to rent a private apartment with the flexibility to avoid a
                tenancy
                agreement and only stay for the desired length.
                <br><br>
                Sterling Executive Residential is relatively new to the corporate apartment sector having only begun its
                operations in 2015. The brand is rapidly expanding with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of
                145% forecasted for the next year.
                Sterling Executive Residential rents its own properties as opposed to many
                other online travel agencies that list apartments from third parties on their sites. Most of our
                properties are in the three to four-star category with luxury properties coming soon. The apartments
                are available with one or two bedrooms across Camden, Hackney, Islington, City of London, and
                Tower Hamlets.
